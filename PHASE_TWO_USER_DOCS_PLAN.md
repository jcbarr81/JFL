Absolutely‚Äîlet‚Äôs bake **comprehensive user documentation** into Phase Two so players (GM/Coach) always know what to do. Below is an add-on you can drop into your repo as a new section (or a separate file like `PHASE_TWO_USER_DOCS_PLAN.md`). It integrates docs tasks into each feature milestone **and** adds a parallel ‚ÄúDocs Workstream‚Äù with its own acceptance criteria, tooling, and example Codex prompts.

# Phase Two ‚Äì User Documentation Workstream (GM & Coach Focus)

**Docs goals:** Clear, click-by-click guides; context help inside the app; searchable website; tutorials; troubleshooting; accessible language.
**Audience:** New players, returning players, power users (play designer, franchise tinkers).
**Tone:** Friendly, authoritative, visual (screenshots, short GIFs), minimal jargon, consistent glossary.

---

## A. Doc Tooling & Architecture (Do this first)

**Do**

* Choose static site generator: **MkDocs + Material** (searchable, awesome nav, dark mode).
* Repo layout:

  ```
  docs/
    index.md
    getting-started/
    gm/
    coach/
    editor/
    analytics/
    season/
    live/
    troubleshooting/
    glossary.md
    faq.md
    changelog.md
  mkdocs.yml
  ```
* Add **docs CI**: build on PR; publish on `main` to `docs/` site (GitHub Pages or artifact).
* Screenshot/GIF process: lightweight script to export **UI screenshots** and **short GIFs** (LICEcap/ShareX or PySide snapshot). Store in `docs/assets/`.
* ‚ÄúHelp beacon‚Äù pattern: `?` buttons that deep-link to exact docs sections using anchors.

**Definition of Done**

* `mkdocs serve` runs locally; full site renders with search/nav and dark/light theme.
* CI builds docs; publishing works from `main`.
* Template page includes: title, 1-paragraph overview, bullet goals, steps, screenshots, tips, and ‚ÄúRelated‚Äù links.
* App has a **global Help menu** linking to the docs home and a **context help router** (e.g., `help://depth-chart` ‚Üí opens browser to `/coach/depth-chart/#drag-and-drop`).

**Example Codex prompt**

> Create an `mkdocs.yml` using Material theme with dark/light toggle, search, version switcher, and a left nav that mirrors our docs/ tree. Add a custom 404 page and site footer with version/build hash.
