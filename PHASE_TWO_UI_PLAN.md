Here‚Äôs a **Phase Two UI/UX & Franchise Experience** project plan, written in Markdown so you can drop it into your repo as `PHASE_TWO_UI_PLAN.md`. It‚Äôs ordered, step-by-step, and every step includes **Definition of Done** and **example Codex prompts**. The plan integrates each new capability directly into the GUI so the app feels like a real **GM/Coach** simulator as you build.

## 0) Design System & UI Architecture Foundation

**Goal:** Establish a consistent look/feel, component library, and navigation framework so subsequent features drop in cleanly.

**Do**

* Create `ui/core/` for shared widgets (AppWindow, NavSidebar, TopBar, Theming, Dialogs, Toasts, Confirmations, BusyOverlay).
* Establish **theme tokens**: colors, typography, spacing, radii, elevation; implement Qt stylesheets (QSS).
* Add a simple **state bus** (signals/slots or a lightweight event hub) for cross-page updates (e.g., ‚Äúroster changed‚Äù, ‚Äúcap updated‚Äù).
* Add **loading/error** patterns and **empty-state** placeholders for all tables and panes.

**Definition of Done**

* A new ‚ÄúAppWindow‚Äù with sidebar + topbar renders and can host dummy pages.
* One source of truth for theme; dark/light toggle works globally.
* Shared components: `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton`, `IconButton`, `Table`, `Card`, `Tag`, `Pill`, `FormRow`, `Modal`, `Toast`.
* Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+S` (save), `Ctrl+F` (search), `Esc` (close modal).
* Unit/UI tests for component creation and theming injection.

**Codex Prompt**

> PySide6: Build `AppWindow` with a permanent left `NavSidebar` and a `TopBar`. Provide a `PageRouter` (QStackedWidget) that switches pages on sidebar clicks. Add a `Theme` class with dark/light palettes and a function to apply QSS app-wide.

---

## 1) App Shell & Navigation Hub

**Goal:** A ‚ÄúHome‚Äù dashboard that orients the user each time they open the app.

* Add top-level nav routes: *Home, Team, Coach, GM, Playbooks, Season, Analytics, Settings*.

**Definition of Done**

* Sidebar routes switch pages without memory leaks.
* Dashboard tiles load fast (<200 ms after data fetch).
* All tiles link to their detail pages.

**Codex Prompt**

> Create a `HomeDashboard` view with cards (Next Game, Cap Room, Injuries, News). Each card should load via async tasks and show skeleton loaders, then hydrate content.
