- Deterministic execution with seeds for testability and balancing.

### Nonâ€‘Goals (Initial Phases)
- 3D graphics or advanced rendering.
- Online multiplayer.
- Full CBA/cap realism (start simple; add later).

### â€œRealisticâ€ Statistical Targets (initial)
- Plays per team per game: **60â€“75**  
- Pass completion rate: **58â€“68%**  
- Yards per attempt: **6.0â€“7.8**  
- Sack rate: **5â€“9%** of dropbacks  
- INT rate: **1.5â€“3%** of attempts  
- Rush YPC: **4.0â€“4.7**  
- Penalties/team: **4â€“9**

## Crossâ€‘Cutting Definition of Done

For **every** step below, it is Done when:
- âœ... Code formatted (black), lintâ€‘clean (ruff), typed (mypy)  
- âœ... Unit tests added/updated; `pytest` passes  
- âœ... Public functions have docstrings and/or docs updated  
- âœ... Determinism preserved where claimed  
- âœ... No behaviorâ€‘affecting TODOs remain

---

## Sanity Gates (Milestone Tests)

1. **Play Sim Sanity** â€“ 1,000 slantâ€‘flat plays: completion 60â€“75%, INT 1â€“3%, sack 3â€“8%.  
2. **Full Game** â€“ 120 plays, no clock/yard anomalies; totals reconcile; box score consistent.  
3. **Season Stability** â€“ Full roundâ€‘robin completes; standings match game results; no crashes.  
4. **Calibration** â€“ League averages fall within targets after sliders tuned.  
5. **Draft Loop** â€“ Year rolls, rookies drafted, injuries reset, schedule regenerates.

---

## Codex Prompting Playbook

**Pattern: Testâ€‘First, Small Functions, Clear Constraints**

**General Template**
```python
# Context: sim/engine.py
# Goal: Implement tackle_success with attributes-based probability.
# Constraints:
# - Use tak vs btk diff, approach angle (0Â° head-on best), relative speed.
# - Baseline 0.65 at equal skills, ~30Â° approach, logistic scaling.
# - < 40 lines, stdlib only, deterministic with seeded RNG.
# Tests: see tests/test_tackle.py expected rates.

def tackle_success(...):
    ...
```
**Refactor Prompt**
> Refactor `simulate_play` into helpers: target selection, movement, contact resolution, event emission. Preserve behavior. Add type hints and tests for helpers.

**UI Prompt**
> In `ui/play_editor/editor.py`, add â€œMirror Left/Rightâ€ that reflects xâ€‘coordinates across midfield. Keep time values unchanged. Update validation accordingly.

**API Prompt**
> In `app/api/games.py`, implement `POST /game/simulate` to accept team IDs and a seed, run a game, persist results, and return summary with final score, drive chart, and top performers.

**Calibration Prompt**
> Given observed stats vs. target bands, compute deltas and propose bounded (Â±10%) adjustments for completion%, pressure%, int%, yac%, and rush_block%.

---

## Risk Register & Mitigations

- **Scope creep** â†’ Gate advanced features behind flags; prioritize MVP.  
- **Performance bottlenecks** â†’ Profile first; parallelize perâ€‘game; avoid premature microâ€‘opts.  
- **Realism drift** â†’ Centralize sliders; run calibration after engine changes.  
- **Data integrity** â†’ Strong schemas; test save/load determinism; migrations as needed.  
- **UI friction** â†’ Editor stays minimal and schemaâ€‘first; validation before save.

**Notes**
- Store longâ€‘lived entities (players, teams, seasons, games, box scores) in SQL; store **plays** as JSON on disk and register in DB for versioning.
- Use deterministic seeds per `(season, week, home_id, away_id)` to ensure reproducibility.
